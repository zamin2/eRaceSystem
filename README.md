### Some steps before running the app
- Please make sure the web connection string is correct with your server name. Currently the data source is set to .
- Please intall the database before running the application as we have implemented security and authentication of users that exists in the database. If a user is not authenticated, then the current user will not have access to the subsystems. Authentication can be done by logging in at the Login page. All the login credintials are located in the About webpage for development purposes.
- Instructions to install the eRace database are located in the Database subfolder of ProjectSpecs in this repository
